# QField Plugin Workshop : FOSSGIS 2026

## Conclusion

That is it.  I am done.  We are done.

We have learned all the important points in the QField interface:

Participants will learn:

- how to deliver a basic project plugin
- how to open your plugin when a feature is selected on the map
- how to add a screen button to open and close the plugin
- how to retrieve information from a selected feature
- how to access a project layer
- how to retrieve a feature from a layer
- how to add, delete and update features

And we've learned some basic QML:

- code structure
- styling and layout basics
- connecting widget behavior with declarative property bindings
- connecting widget behavior with signals and javascript functions

## What to do next

### 1. Hook up to the QField Community

If you aren't already there, sign in to https://community.qfield.org and join the QField community.

Feel free to drop me a line or a question there @Heather_Hillers

### 2. Keep up with new plugins

Keep an eye on the QField Plugin page on GitHub for more plugin examples:

https://github.com/topics/qfield-plugin

### 3. Keep up with the docs

The QField documentation for plugins is still in it's beginning stages and is continuously developed.  Check it every few months for new developments, especially in the QField API.

https://docs.qfield.org/how-to/advanced-how-tos/plugins/

### 4. Steal this workshop.

This workshop was a lot of work to make and I don't give workshops for a living. I dont have the resources to take it much farther.  So lets make the most of this. Please take this workshop, share it, copy it, change it, translate it, record it, cannabalize it, use it in your documentation.  Whatever you want.  

This material will stay at:

and

### 5. Share your plugins

Right now there are very few examples of project level QField plugins.  I actually don't know of any except this one.  This is bad.  No one knows how to build these things.

 We need more code examples so we can learn how to build more stuff.  If you build something, share it, even if it is too specialized for someone else to use.  
 
 - Put it on GitHub
 - Send me a link. @Heather_Hillers on the QField Community Page.  I'd love to see it.
 - Post it in the Show and Tell Section of the QField Community site.
 - If it's in good working condition, add it to the QField Plugin examples Page by following the instructions at https://github.com/topics/qfield-plugin
 

### 6. Learn more QML

Yeah.  QML is not Python.

The Qt Academy is the best place we know to learn QML.  We would suggest the [Qt Academy Introduction to QML](https://www.qt.io/academy/course-catalog#introduction-to-qml) as a good starting point.

Once you get through that, there are many more follow up courses you can try out.


Good Luck and Godspeed!
