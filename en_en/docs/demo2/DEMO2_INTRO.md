# Demonstration 2: Feature Selection 

This demonstration builds on Demo 1 by adding the ability to select a feature from the map and to retrieve information from that feature to use in the plugin.

## What we will learn

- How to access a project layer through the QField interface
- How to query features from a layer through the QField interface
- How to select objects from the map canvas using a point handler
- How to send a signal to close the plugin
- How to align items using Layout Containers

## What does it do?
 
- It opens when the user doubleclicks on a plot on the map canvas.
- It displays the plot id of the selected feature in the text frame.
- A single click on the point will result in the usual Attribute Table behaviour. (On iOS.  This is not possible in the Windows executable.)

- It also prints messages to the dos console instead of the user's message log when a map feature is selected.

# Set it up

1. Create a new project directory: ${ROOT}/qfield_project_demo_2 
2. Copy the whole demo directory \${ROOT}/qfield_vegetation_plugin/demo2_selection ${ROOT}/qfield_project_demo_2
3. Open the project in QGIS if you want, but you don't have to.  The project has not changed from demo 1.
4. Run Qfield from the command line to open the project directly as a local project.
```dos
"C:\Program Files\QField\usr\bin\qfield.exe C:\temp\qfield\demo2_selection\demo2_selection.qgs
```
