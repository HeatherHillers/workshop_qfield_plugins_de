# QField Plugin Workshop : FOSSGIS 2026


This workshop provides guidance to developers for building QField plugins. The workshop materials are based on practical examples from the [qfield_vegetation_monitoring](https://github.com/HeatherHillers/qfield_vegetation_monitoring) repository.  

Participants will learn:

- how to deliver a basic project plugin
- how to open your plugin when a feature is selected on the map
- how to add a screen button to open and close the plugin
- how to retrieve information from a selected feature
- how to access a project layer
- how to retrieve a feature from a layer
- how to add, delete and update features

We will introduce the user briefly to the QML required to build the plugin.  The user will need further QML instruction to successfully continue.

The Qt Academy is the best place we know to learn QML.  We would suggest the [Qt Academy Introduction to QML](https://www.qt.io/academy/course-catalog#introduction-to-qml) as a good starting point.
